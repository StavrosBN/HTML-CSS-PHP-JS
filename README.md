# HTML-CSS-PHP-JS
Project from my University

On my 7th semester of my studies i had to make a website that
all the students of my faculty would use for their thesis. 
On the website i worked with my colleague witch he made the Teacher's page
and we worked together on the Secretary's page. 
I worked on the Student's page and only used HTML, CSS, PHP and some JAVASCRIPT.
My friend also used NODE.JS. 
On the student page there was no use of any bootstrap templates because i wanted to keep it simple and
not bother with the style so much.
We used PHPMyAdmin so we dont waste time on any database program. 
Runs on local server.
